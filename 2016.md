### Todo list for 2016 branch

Whatever that can be solved before Monday the 16th would be great. We have to hard freeze all 2016 development there and push whatever we have. The remaining goes into to the wish list pile for the April update =)


* [git clone instead of File Manager](https://github.com/dtu-compute/dtu-enote-website/issues/58)
* [Pictures not showing up](https://github.com/dtu-compute/dtu-quiz/issues/205)
* [Serve Askbot under a subpath](https://github.com/dtu-compute/dtu-enote-askbot/issues/3)
* [Sort podcasts in newest at the top](https://github.com/dtu-compute/dtu-enote-website/issues/63)
* [Possible to have multiple podcasts channels](https://github.com/dtu-compute/dtu-enote-website/issues/64)
